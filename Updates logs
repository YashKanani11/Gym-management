Started this project today@11PM.
chatGPT gave me set of requirement as follows:
1. Color pallet
2. App preffreence- mobile first backend heavy work without network
3. Members/trainers/admin pages
4. MOney tracker and notification reminders

MVP required as Version 1.0
  For Now (Version 1):
  Let’s just make an Admin Page — that’s all I need.
  I don’t think members care about logging in and checking stuff yet. I’ll show them their end date or plan if they ask. Right now, I just need:
  - Add/edit/remove members
  - Track payments  
  - Get alerts for renewals
  - Assign trainers
  - Keep workout notes

  Later, if members want to log in and track their own stuff, maybe we’ll add that as a second version.

Update @2:25 AM
Made the 1.0 figma design file
